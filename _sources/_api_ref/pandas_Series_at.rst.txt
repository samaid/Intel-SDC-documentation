pandas.Series.at
****************
    Access a single value for a row/column label pair.

    Similar to ``loc``, in that both provide label-based lookups. Use
    ``at`` if you only need to get or set a single value in a DataFrame
    or Series.

Raises

    KeyError
        When label does not exist in DataFrame
